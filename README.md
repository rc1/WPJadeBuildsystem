# Jade/Less/BrowserSync/Babel Wordpress Theme Buildsystem

A skeleton setup for creating a WordPress theme using [gulp](http://gulpjs.com), [jade](http://jadelang), [less](http://lesscss.org), [browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/), [babel](https://babeljs.io/) and a few other javascript lovelies. 

This repo is not a theme. It's a buildsystem. To create a new theme, first create a folder in `wp-content/themes` then clone this repo your new folder. So this repo might sit at `wp-content/themes/mytheme/src`. When the buildsystem is run, it will place build files into it's parent directory. I.e. `wp-content/themes/mytheme/src`
